# Scroll--Indicator
This project is a Scroll Indicator that visually displays how much of a webpage has been scrolled. As the user scrolls through the content, the indicator updates in real-time to show the percentage of the page viewed. This can be useful for improving user experience on long pages, articles, or blogs.
